# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository contains implementations of widely studied RL algorithms. The Open AI Gym environment provides easy to use environments to train the RL agents.
The Open AI website (https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html) provides an overview of the RL algorithms . RL algorithms can be broadly classified into model free and model based learning methods. The chart below presents the taxonomy of RL methods as defined by Open AI.  ![Screenshot 2021-05-05 at 2 27 30 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77635204/117118132-0aada900-adae-11eb-8199-e80677b6a2e0.png)
